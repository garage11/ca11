# 1. Record architecture decisions

Date: 2020-10-27

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to record the architectural decisions made on this project.

## Decision

We will use Architecture Decision Records, as described by Michael Nygard in
this article: http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions.

## Consequences

From now on, major architectural decisions will go through ADR and PR review,
to make sure that the project is moving forward through consensus.
